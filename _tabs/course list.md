Starting in Fall of 2024, the faculty of Applied Mathematics major will mostly follow 
the following (unofficial) course schedule indefinitely. 
The table should be self-explanatory. However, there are a few points about the alternating courses:

- Classes that are meant to alternate with each other, year by year, will be listed as `Course 1/Course 2`.
- Some courses are offered every other year and will be marked as `alternate`.

Limited exceptions may happen due to different circumstances and will be communicated clearly,
in advanced to the students via emails and official schedule sent out from Academic Affairs.

Students may use this for general course planning for their career at Fulbright.

### MATH 102: Ideas of Mathematics

Mathematics is more than computations and solving equations. Often, what excites math lovers isn’t
just the answer to a particular problem but the ideas behind the explanations and how they lead to new
insights and possibilities. At its best, mathematics contains all of the following: creativity, beauty and,
of course, precision. A masterpiece in mathematics could be compared to a great drawing or a classic
novel. As an example, Martin Hairer’s regularity structure is compared to Lord of the Rings on Quanta
Magazine.
The course will be a survey of some of the fundamental ideas in mathematics in the past two hundred
years (possibly even more). It starts with the basic language of modern mathematics, logic and set
theory. Then, depending on the interests and time, we will discuss about some (but not limited to) of
the following topics: infinity, number theory, combinatorics, probability, game theory, linear algebra,
discrete dynamical systems.

### MATH 305: Stochastic Calculus

Many business or financial processes are occurring randomly every moment, but business managers or investors need to monitor them constantly as well as predict their future short-term and long-term movements to propose appropriate action plans. For instance, stock investors always want to update their current stock values as well as the future stock price movement directions. Sale managers also want to predict the number of customers buying their products next months for better business plans. This course aims to equip students’ knowledge and skills to meet such business demands. In particular, students learn about properties of different random processes, how to model some random phenomena by suitable random processes and how to simulate possible future movements of the phenomena.

This course will help you build such a financial plan. Through the course, you will sense the amazing power of compounded interests in accumulating a small amount of money to a much bigger one over time. In addition, you will learn how to build and manage your investment portfolios wisely to obtain good returns with acceptable risks. Furthermore, you are introduced to financial derivatives such as future contracts and options to hedge your portfolios or even speculate your market predictions.

eventually converge? Is there a function that is continuous everywhere but nowhere
differentiable? What is the relationship between continuity and integrability? Real Analysis
answers these questions and many more. This course revisits familiar topics, such as real
numbers, sequences, series, topology in the real line, limits, continuity, and integrals, but studies
them in a mathematically rigorous way. It can be the first exposure of students to abstract
