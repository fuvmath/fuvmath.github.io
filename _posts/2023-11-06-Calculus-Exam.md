The math faculty would like to organize a calculus placement test on Saturday, 
Nov 18, 2023 for students, who would like to take a test (with a pass result) 
to substitute for a calculus course so that they can take other courses that 
require calculus as a prerequisite.

The test is 90 minutes and there will 30 questions (one point for each).
