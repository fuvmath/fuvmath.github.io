|    | Insufficient <br>  0 point | Satisfactory <br> 1 point | Good <br> 2 points | Excellent <br> 3 points |
|  :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|   Understanding the material | Fails, despite guidance  from the supervisor | studies literature with  guidance from the  supervisor | independently studies  literature | independently finds and  studies literature |
|   Critical arguments about the results, literature or specialists | Fails to understand | Understands those of  supervisor | Joins the supervisor in  discussing | Comes up with their own |
|   Taking responsibility for  the project and working  independently; handling  data (if applicable) | Takes no responsibility,  shows no independence,  unreliable handling. | Takes responsibility, works  semi-independently,  clearly needing  supervision, handles data  quite reliably | Takes responsibility, works  independently with some  need of supervision,  handles data in a reliable  manner | Takes responsibility for  the project and works  independently, and if  applicable, handles data  in a reliable manner |
|   Communication with  supervisor, planning  meetings, leading  discussions | Communicates badly,  plans inconsistently, no  participation. | Communicates well, plans  consistently, lets the  supervisor lead the  discussion | Communicates well, plans  consistently and actively  participates | Communicates well plans  consistently and takes  initiative |

| Style | The thesis contains a large number of spelling or grammatical errors; focus often drifts from the subject | Suitable, but sometimes inconsistent, but creates a decent flow; contains only few spelling or grammatical errors | Suitable and has a good flow; contains only few spelling or grammatical errors | Almost perfect, engaging to read |
| Layout and organization | Poor | Clear to read | Clear to read | Clear to read |
| Proofs | Poor | Minor errors | Error-free | Error-free and pleasant to read |
|Theorems, propositions and lemmas  | Poorly chosen and not connected | Chosen with some shortcomings | Well-chosen | Well-chosen |
| Examples and/or figures | Absent or irrelevant | Reasonably chosen but could be better | Well-chosen | Well-chosen, interesting, and judiciously placed to aid readers |
