All the Applied Math majors and minors are invited to join 
a round-table meeting with
the faculty  to celebrate the end of the semester.

During this meeting, we will talk about the experience of math students
in the past semester
and let the students ask questions to the faculty about the major and 
future job prospects.
Pizzas will be provided to facilitate the welcoming environment.

We hope to see you there!
